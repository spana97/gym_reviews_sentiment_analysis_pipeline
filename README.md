# Gym Reviews Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

Sentiment analysis of Google and Trustpilot customer reviews for an undisclosed gym.

## Description

This project focuses on analysing customer feedback from Google and Trustpilot reviews for an undisclosed gym.

> **Note:** The dataset used in this project is **synthetic**, generated using Python's Faker library.  
> All names, reviews, and other data points are **fictitious** and do not represent real individuals or actual gym locations.

This project focuses on analysing customer feedback from Google and Trustpilot reviews for a gym. The aim is to understand customer sentiment, identify recurring themes in negative feedback, and extract actionable insights that can help improve customer satisfaction and overall service quality.

Initially, the project will implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to combine, clean, and structure both datasets before applying topic modelling techniques.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

At this stage of the project, the full dependency list is still evolving and will be finalised once the ETL and analysis components are implemented.

Known upcoming dependencies include (but are not limited to):

- Python 3.x
- BERTopic
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk / spaCy

A full requirements list will be added once the pipeline is implemented.

### Installing

Installation instructions will be provided once the project structure is established and dependencies are confirmed.

### Executing program

Execution steps will be added after the initial ETL pipeline is implemented. Expected workflow:

1. Run the ETL pipeline to combine and clean Google + Trustpilot reviews.
1. Load the transformed output CSV.
1. Run the topic modelling script (BERTopic) on negative reviews.

Sample command blocks will be included once the scripts exist.

## Help

This section will be expanded as the project develops. Future items may include:

- Common environment issues
- Missing dependencies
- How to re-run BERTopic visualisations
